## About The Project

<br />

“Throne Seeker” is an Indie game about a wizard with a gorgeous cape trying to find the key to enter the throne room and defeat the king, saving the village’s population.
<br />
As stated before, your goal is to reach the throne room by fighting enemies, prepared to face difficult journeys in this castle, opening chests to earn money to buy items in the shot and become stronger. But wait, maybe there’s a story behind the shop keeper… He was talking about a Potion of Love?...
